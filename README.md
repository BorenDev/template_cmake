# Template CMake Project

## Overview

This repo provides a boiler plate cmake project with some features I find interesting, as well as a project to further explore the features of CMake.

## Using this Project

A way to use this project is to clone the repo, delete the .git repo (unless you want it's history...) and initialize a new repo. Add/commit all files as an initial commit and begin to customize for your needs. The project name `template_cmake` can be searched/replaced with the new project name - both inside of files and filenames/dirnames will need to change.
